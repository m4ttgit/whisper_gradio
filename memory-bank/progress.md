## Progress: Whisper Gradio API

### What Works
- Basic project structure is in place.
- Initial memory bank files have been created.
- `.gitignore` exists.

### What's Left to Build
- Gradio interface in `main.py`.
- API call logic in `api_call.py`.
- Transcription functions in `transcription.py`.
- Utility functions in `utils.py`.
- Workflow definition in `whisper_workflow.json` (if applicable).

### Current Status
- Initial project setup and documentation.
- Investigating the accidental commit of the `.env` file.

### Known Issues
- The `.env` file was accidentally pushed to the repository.

### Evolution of Project Decisions
- Using environment variables for configuration.
- Excluding sensitive files from version control using `.gitignore`.
