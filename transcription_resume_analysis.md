# Transcription Resume Capability Analysis

## Question
Is it possible to continue transcription if the script was stopped instead of starting all over?

## Current Status: Not Possible

Based on analysis of `main.py` and `transcription.py`, the script does not currently support resuming interrupted transcriptions.

## Technical Limitations

### 1. No Checkpointing
- The script doesn't save intermediate progress or state
- Each transcription job runs as a single, atomic operation
- No partial results are persisted

### 2. Memory-Based Job Tracking
- `job_store` dictionary tracks only overall job status (pending/complete/failed) in memory
- All job history is lost if the script restarts
- No persistent storage for job state

### 3. Temporary File Cleanup
- Downloaded videos are stored in temporary directories
- Temp directories are cleaned up immediately after processing
- No reuse of partially downloaded content

### 4. No Resume in yt-dlp
- yt-dlp supports download resumption, but current implementation doesn't enable it
- Missing `--continue` flag or similar resume options

### 5. Full Video Processing
- Both Whisper and Groq API process entire video/audio files at once
- No built-in support for partial transcription
- No segment-based progress tracking

## Potential Improvements for Resume Capability

### Core Features
- **Progress Tracking**: Implement timestamps/segments for partial progress
- **Persistent Storage**: Use database/file system for job state instead of memory
- **Download Resume**: Enable yt-dlp resume flags (`--continue`, `--no-part`)
- **Partial Caching**: Save intermediate transcription results
- **Recovery Logic**: Detect interrupted jobs and continue from last checkpoint

### Implementation Areas
1. **Job Persistence**: Replace in-memory `job_store` with file/database
2. **Download Management**: Modify yt-dlp calls to support resumption
3. **Transcription Segmentation**: Break long videos into chunks with progress tracking
4. **State Recovery**: Add logic to detect and resume incomplete jobs on startup
5. **Error Handling**: Better handling of interruptions with automatic retry

### Benefits
- Avoid re-downloading large videos
- Skip already-transcribed segments
- Reduce processing time for interrupted jobs
- Improve reliability for long-running transcriptions

## Files Analyzed
- `main.py`: Main application logic and job management
- `transcription.py`: Core transcription functions and video processing

## Recommendation
Implement the above improvements incrementally, starting with persistent job storage and yt-dlp resume functionality.
